# Corrections ledger

Every claim withdrawn or revised, dated, at the same size as the claim it replaces.

The rule (`docs/OPERATING_RULES.md` §5): an over-claim against our own interest is still an
over-claim and gets filed here at full size. Entries are append-only. Nothing is deleted; a
correction that is itself wrong gets a further entry.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD - <one-line description>
**Claimed:**   what was said, quoted, with where it was said.
**Actual:**    what is true, with the artifact that establishes it.
**Size:**      how much the claim moved, in the units of the claim.
**Cause:**     why the wrong version was written.
**Fix:**       what changed in the instrument so this class of error is caught next time.
```

*No entries yet. This file exists before the first result so that the first correction has
somewhere to go that was not built in response to it.*
