# Corrections ledger

Every claim withdrawn or revised, dated, at the same size as the claim it replaces.

The rule (`docs/OPERATING_RULES.md` §5): an over-claim against our own interest is still an
over-claim and gets filed here at full size. Entries are append-only. Nothing is deleted; a
correction that is itself wrong gets a further entry.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD - <one-line description>
**Claimed:**   what was said, quoted, with where it was said.
**Actual:**    what is true, with the artifact that establishes it.
**Size:**      how much the claim moved, in the units of the claim.
**Cause:**     why the wrong version was written.
**Fix:**       what changed in the instrument so this class of error is caught next time.

## 2026-08-25 — Published a scaling-rate figure that our own reproduction does not reproduce

**Claimed.** In `docs/_domain_selection_analysis.md`, under law L3(i): *"a learned model on 27 joint
features scores **0.2384** at 13,500 rows, rising **+2.8 accuracy points per decade**. Closing that
gap needs roughly 27 more decades of data."* Repeated in `VERDICT.md` as *"climbs only a couple of
accuracy points per decade"*. Both were taken from a subagent's measurement and stated as fact.

**Actual.** Re-derived here from scratch with six real CDCL solvers via PySAT
(`tools/repro/sat_solver_identity.py`, banked in `artifacts/verification/repro_sat_comparison.json`),
at the same top rung of 13,500 training rows: the learned model reaches **0.1800**, not 0.2384; the
slope is **+1.21** accuracy points per decade, not +2.8; and the gap closes in **66.6** decades, not
27. Three other figures from the same subagent *did* reproduce — determinism exactly (1530 of 1530
re-solves returning the byte-identical model), the free decoder closely (0.9857 against 0.9863), and
the divergence result more strongly (all six solvers agreed on 0 of 3,000 instances against 0 of 339).

**Size.** One of three headline numbers in one of the three laws that close Phase 0, wrong by more
than a factor of two on the slope and by a factor of 2.5 on the decades. The qualitative claim — a
free zero-training decoder near 0.986 against a learned model near the 0.1667 chance level, with a
gap no realistic quantity of data closes — survives intact and is if anything strengthened.

**Cause, and the part that matters.** The error runs in the direction that *flatters our own
conclusion*: a weaker learned arm makes law L3(i) look stronger. That is precisely why it cannot be
quietly corrected by adopting the better-looking number. The most likely explanation is **not** that
the subagent was wrong but that **the feature set implemented here is worse than the one it used** —
both of our runs sit barely above chance, which is what an underpowered feature set looks like. The
subagent's code lived in an ephemeral scratch directory and is gone, so the two implementations
cannot be diffed and the cause cannot be established. Underlying all of it: a number measured by a
subagent, in a directory that no longer exists, was written into a published document as though it
were established.

**Fix.** Three changes, all made. (1) Neither figure is quoted as established anywhere. The documents
now state the qualitative claim, cite the reproduced numbers as reproduced, and record the subagent's
as not reproduced. (2) The reproduction ships as runnable code and both runs are banked, including
the first run that could **not** reach the top rung — kept so the run that did cannot be mistaken for
the only one. (3) `artifacts/verification/coverage.json` now carries an explicit `neither` row for
the subagent's SAT figures whose stated reason is that this repository tried to reproduce them and
could not.

## 2026-08-25 — Miscounted the ACS PUMS allocation-flag columns, and blamed a subagent for it

**Claimed.** In `artifacts/phase0/reproduction_alloctrace.json`, first version, under
`discrepancies`: the round-2 reviewing agent reported "77 contiguous allocation flags" in the
2023 ACS PUMS person file; this repository recorded "76 columns match the filter
`startswith('F') and endswith('P')`" and assessed the gap as "a naming-filter difference, not a
substantive disagreement", listing it as a discrepancy in an artifact whose stated purpose was
checking the agent's work.

**Actual.** There are exactly **77** allocation flags, and the agent's count was right. The
person file has 80 columns beginning with `F`; three of them — `FER` (gave birth in the past 12
months), `FOD1P` and `FOD2P` (recoded field of degree) — are substantive data variables that
merely start with `F`. Three genuine flags end in `C` rather than `P` (`FHINS3C`, `FHINS4C`,
`FHINS5C`), which is why the filter used here does not return 77. The full column list is in the
banked artifact and can be recounted by anyone.

**Size.** One column in an absolute count (76 vs 77, 1.3% of the count). Substantively larger
than that: the entry appeared in a verification artifact, under a heading that reads as "what
the agent got wrong", and it recorded a defect in this repository's own check as though it were
a defect in the thing being checked. The direction of the error is the part that matters. An
independent-verification artifact that manufactures a discrepancy is worse than one that finds
none, because its whole value is that its findings can be trusted in both directions.

**Cause.** A regex-shaped assumption — that PUMS allocation flags are exactly the columns
matching `F*P` — was written into a one-off check and never tested against the data dictionary,
then reported as a measurement. It is the same failure this repository has spent two rounds
killing in other people's candidates: a heuristic mistaken for ground truth. It was caught only
because the raw column list was printed alongside the count, which is luck, not process.

**Fix.** Two changes, both made. (1) The artifact now records 77 with its derivation stated
explicitly, so the count can be checked without rerunning anything. (2) The standing rule, now
in `docs/OPERATING_RULES.md` §8: a count derived from a *pattern over names* is not a
measurement until the pattern has been checked against the authoritative definition, and any
artifact reporting such a count must print the derivation beside it. Where a check disagrees
with the thing it is checking, the check is assumed wrong until it is shown otherwise.
